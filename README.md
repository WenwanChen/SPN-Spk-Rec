Sum-Product Networks for Robust Automatic Speaker Recognition
====
Please note that this repository is currently in its early stages
-----

Sum-product networks are used here for robust speaker recognition. The marginalisation missing feature approach is used as the model-compensation technique to improve the robustness. 

SPFlow is modified to accomadate the implementation.
